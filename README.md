# SmartEye2

During my internship, I worked on a program developed for washing machines used in the workplace. This program is utilized for transferring the values displayed on the machines' panels to a computer. The data acquired from the PLC is processed in the program, allowing us to monitor the real-time efficiency and consumption of all machines collectively or individually.

To enhance the responsiveness and dynamism of the program's main screen, I created a panel on a Windows form. I also added images related to its movements, which you can find below.

As the main window narrows, the distances between controls inside the panel vary proportionally to the panel's width.

The side panel menu can be opened and closed, and the icons and texts of the controls (buttons) inside dynamically move according to the panel's width. You can observe the relevant code snippets in both the file and the visuals.

Within the side menu, I implemented a control for sub-menus that need to be opened. You can see the corresponding codes in the file.
